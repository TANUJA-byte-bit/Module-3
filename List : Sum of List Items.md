# 3a) List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

##  Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

##  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Python’s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

##  Program
```
list1=[1,2,-8]
sum_numbers = 0
for x in list1:
   sum_numbers += x

print(sum_numbers)
```
